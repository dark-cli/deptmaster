# ✅ Icons Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

### Missing Icon Files
- ✅ Created `web/icons/Icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- ✅ Created `web/favicon.png` (32x32 pixels)
- ✅ Rebuilt Flutter web app
- ✅ Restarted web server

## Other Warnings (Normal)

These are **normal** and don't affect functionality:

1. **Service worker messages**: Normal for Flutter web apps
2. **Source map error**: Doesn't affect functionality, just debugging info
3. **Browser detection warning**: Normal for Flutter web
4. **WebGL warnings**: Normal for CanvasKit renderer in Firefox

## Test It

1. **Open**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Check console**: Icon 404 errors should be gone!
3. **Everything else**: Still works perfectly

## What Changed

- Created placeholder blue icons
- Icons are now included in the build
- No more 404 errors for icons

**Console should be much cleaner now!** 🎉

The app functionality is unchanged - just cleaner console output.
