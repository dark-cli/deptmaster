# When building from repo root (e.g. dev server), Cargo only reads this directory,
# not frontend/.cargo. So we set wasm flags here too to fix "clone_ref" when
# running dx serve from root.
# Rust 1.82+ enables wasm reference-types by default; wasm-bindgen-cli can fail
# with "failed to find intrinsics to enable clone_ref function" unless we disable.
