# ✅ Name Sorting Complete!

## What Was Added

### Money (Transactions) Sorting - Name Options
Added both **"Name (A to Z)"** and **"Name (Z to A)"** sorting options

## Updated Sorting Options

### Money Tab Sorting:
1. **Most Recent** (default) - Newest transactions first
2. **Oldest First** - Oldest transactions first
3. **Amount (High to Low)** - Highest amounts first
4. **Amount (Low to High)** - Lowest amounts first
5. **Name (A to Z)** - Sorted by contact name A to Z ✨
6. **Name (Z to A)** - Sorted by contact name Z to A ✨

## How It Works

- **Name (A to Z)**: Sorts transactions by contact name alphabetically (A to Z)
- **Name (Z to A)**: Sorts transactions by contact name reverse alphabetically (Z to A)
- "Unknown" contacts appear at the end for A to Z, or at the beginning for Z to A

## How to Use

1. **Open**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Go to Money tab**
3. **Tap sort icon (☰)** in top right
4. **Select "Name (A to Z)" or "Name (Z to A)"**
5. **Transactions sorted by contact name!**

## Test It

After rebuilding, try:
- Tap sort icon
- Choose "Name (A to Z)" - see transactions from A to Z
- Choose "Name (Z to A)" - see transactions from Z to A

**Both name sorting options are ready!** 🎉
